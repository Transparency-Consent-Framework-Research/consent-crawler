## Introduction
Playwright based crawler designed to collect network telemetry and cookies by interacting with GDPR / TCF consent banners on publisher websites. Used to collect data as part of an academic research project into the adoption and quality of the Trust & Consent Framework put forth by the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB).

The project includes a list of the top 100,000 domains, this list is used to generate the default list of domains to crawl. The list can be any single column CSV list, make_target_list splits the string by line into an array domains.

## Installation 
- Recommended NodeJS Version: 18.x

After entering the directory for the project, install the project dependencies
```
npm install
```
Install the [playwright system dependencies](https://playwright.dev/docs/cli#install-system-dependencies) and respective browsers.
```
npx playwright install-deps
```

## Usage
If the crawler is running on headful mode (`launchOptions.headless = false`), you must launch the crawler using [Xvfb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb).

Build the project
```
npm run build
```
Run the crawler
```
xvfb-run --auto-servernum node dist/main.js
```

## Saving Crawl Data
The cralwer uses crawlee's [KeyValue](https://crawlee.dev/docs/guides/result-storage#key-value-store) storage mechanism.

`âš  The default storage is purged on startup between sessions.`

To preserve data between runs, specify a store name during open.
```js
const store = await KeyValueStore.open('my-store-name');
```

Data will be stored in `/storage/key_value_stores/my-storage-name/`
